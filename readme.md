## Overview  üìú
We will predict whether the person's income is above 50K or  below 50k using various features like age, education, and occupation. 
The application is a web app which is developed in Flask Framework.

Read more about it at Blogpost.

## Dataset  
Dataset is available in Kaggle by CarDheko Company.
This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

## Installations  üóÑÔ∏è
The Code is written in Python 3.8 If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:


First you need to create a virtual conda enviornment.

```bash
  conda create -n myenv python=3.6
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Technologies Used

* Python
* FrontEnd: HTML & CSS
* Backend: Flask 

## Motivation

* Building such predictive models can help us better understand the population of a country as well as the various factors affecting the growth in the economy.
* Governments can understand such factors and improve upon them leading to the growth of the country.
## Conclusion
* In this project, we build various models like logistic regression, knn classifier, support vector classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier and xgboost classifier.
* A hyperparameter tuned random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy score of 92.77 and f1 score of 93.08.
